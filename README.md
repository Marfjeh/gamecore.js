# gamecore.js
A Node.js script to make a rcon connection such as a minecraft server

This is a proof of concept, to make a way to interact with a VANILLA Minecraft server without any plugins. Yes, i'm aware this is not the best way... but i wanted to make it to see what's going to happen.

the game doesnt work yet, the first wave works but there's alot of changes coming.

# the game.
The game is based of from Call of Duty Blackops Zombies.
